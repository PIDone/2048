		<h2>How to play (scroll down to read)</h2>
		<div id="instruction">
			<p>This is an implementation of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048</a>.</p>
			<p>Use the Arrow keys, WASD keys or the IJKL keys to shift the tiles up, left, down or right, respectively.</p>
			<p>If two identical tiles are next to each other, shift in that direction and they will merge.</p>
			<p>Every time you merge two tiles, the score will increase by the number on the resulting tile.</p>
			<p>For example, if there are two 8 tiles next to each other horizontally, shifting left or right will merge them into a 16 tile. The score also increases by 16.</p>
			<p>Every time you make a move, a new tile will generate on a random empty tile. It will be either 2 or 4.</p>
			<p>If the board is full and there are no tiles to merge, the game ends.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The default board size is 4, but you can change it with the "resize board" button.</p>
			<p>You are also able to resize the displayed size of the board with the "resize board" button.</p>
			<br>
			<p id="red"><b>I have also written an algorithm to play the game. Press the "Start AI" button to start it.</b></p>
			<p>The AI only work on desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux), though it does not work on the Safari browser.</p>
