# 2048

## Website at https://jlche18659.gitlab.io/2048/

A simple 2048 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) implementation, along with a simple AI to play the game. This website uses Shared Workers (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker), which are **only supported on desktop platforms (ie MacOS, Windows and Linux)**. Additionally, this program will **not** work on Safari and Internet Explorer (_why would anyone use IE today_) as they do not support Shared Workers.

The algorithm to play the game is quite CPU intensive, so be careful when using it.
