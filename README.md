# 2048

Website at https://anonymouscoder999.github.io/2048/

A simple 2048 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) implementation with the functionality to resize the board. Due to the random nature of the game (where a new tile generates & what it generates), it is only able to achieve the 4096 tile when the board is at the default size of 4.
